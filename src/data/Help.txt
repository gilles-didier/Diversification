Diversification Help



To use Diversification, please first open a tree file, next a file containing the corresponding fossils table. The next step consists in setting the parameter of the calculus, which are :

    the « Origin », i.e. the starting time of evolution,

    the « End », i.e. the contemporary time,

    the number of samplings of fossil times uniformly drawn from the interval provided in the fossils file.

The estimation of the diversification and fossil find rates is launched by the item « Compute » of the Diversification menu or alternatively the corresponding item of the toolbar. The computation may be stopped by clicking on the « Stop » button. The mean rates and their standard deviation among the fossil times samplings are displayed as soon as the computation ends.
