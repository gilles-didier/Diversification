/*
    'Diversification' and 'estimate' estimate diversification and fossilization rates frm tree shapes and fossil dates / 
    'sample' simulates random trees and fossils finds and saves them in Newick format / 
    'test' simulates random multiplex to test community detection approaches
	'complexity' simulates random trees and fossils finds, computes their complexity index and return a CSV file with lines
		<complexity index>	<likelihood computation time>	<tree size>	<fossil number>
	'assess' simulates random trees and fossils finds, estimates speciation and extinction rates and returns the mean absolute error
